124	Slide 1: Hello, everyone.Today, Iâ€™m going to talk about blockchain, a revolutionary technology. Here is table of contents.
69	So Firstly, we need to know what is blockchain and how does it works.
125	Slide 2: Blockchain was invented in 1991, when two scientists Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta researched a cryptographic 
125	data storage system that could not be tampered with or altered. However, blockchain only became famous in 2008, when Satoshi 
115	Nakamoto published a paper about Bitcoin, a electronic cash system that uses blockchain as a distributed database. 
123	Blockchain is a type of decentralized database, maintained by multiple computers connected to each other via the Internet. 
121	These computers are called nodes, and they have the task of recording and confirming the legality of all transactions in 
37	blocktrain network, known as blocks. 
126	Each block includes 3 main components: Data, Hash code of the current block and Hash code of the previous block. Hash code is 
113	a randomly generated string of letters and numbers. This code is like our fingerprints, unique and not identical.
125	When you make a transaction, the nodes verify whether your transaction is valid. Then, your verified records will be grouped 
112	into a block. Finally, the newly created block will connect the previous block and the result is a block chain. 
122	Slide 3: So why blockchain is the future . Firstly, it has high security. A traditional  database is a centralized system 
121	that stores data in a single location, such as a server or a cloud. And it rely on firewalls and passwords to secure the 
134	data, but they are more vulnerable to hacking. On the other hand, blockchain uses cryptography to protect the data from modification. 
128	Each block of data has a unique hash that links it to the previous block. Any attempt to alter or delete a block will break the 
38	chain and be rejected by the network. 
121	Secondly, it has decentralization. By using multiple computers connected to each other via the internet, no computer can 
82	control and change the entire blockchain, so data are protected from interference.
118	Thirdly, it has transparency. Each transaction is publicly verified by a community of network users, rather than by a 
18	central authority.
123	Slide 4: But blockchain also has disadvantages. First, Blockchain trilemma is the challenge developers face when trying to 
133	achieve security, decentralization, and scalability. In which processes in one component must be at the expense of another component.
122	The second is 51% attack. For blockchain networks with a small number of users, the Blockchain can be attacked by hackers 
122	with more computing power than the majority of nodes in the network. If this happens, an attacker can change or overwrite 
26	already confirmed blocks. 
115	Slide 5: In conclusion, Blockchain is a new and advanced technology, with potential in many industries and fields. 
118	Blockchain brings many benefits of decentralization, safety and transparency to users. However, blockchain also needs 
40	to solve problem of speed and security.
