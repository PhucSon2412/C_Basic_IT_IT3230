1: Hello, everyone.Today, Iâ€™m going to talk about blockchain, a revolutionary technology. Here is table of contents.So Firstly, we need to know what is blockchain and how does it works.
2: Blockchain was invented in 1991, when two scientists Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta researched a cryptographic data storage system that could not be tampered with or altered. However, blockchain only became famous in 2008, when Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper about Bitcoin, a electronic cash system that uses blockchain as a distributed database.  is a type of decentralized database, maintained by multiple computers connected to each other via the Internet. These computers are called nodes, and they have the task of recording and confirming the legality of all transactions in blocktrain network, known as blocks. Each block includes 3 main components: Data, Hash code of the current block and Hash code of the previous block. Hash code is a randomly generated string of letters and numbers. This code is like our fingerprints, unique and not identical.When you make a transaction, the nodes verify whether your transaction is valid. Then, your verified records will be grouped into a block. Finally, the newly created block will connect the previous block and the result is a block chain. 
3: So why blockchain is the future . Firstly, it has high security. A traditional  database is a centralized system that stores data in a single location, such as a server or a cloud. And it rely on firewalls and passwords to secure the data, but they are more vulnerable to hacking. On the other hand, blockchain uses cryptography to protect the data from modification. Each block of data has a unique hash that links it to the previous block. Any attempt to alter or delete a block will break the chain and be rejected by the network. Secondly, it has decentralization. By using multiple computers connected to each other via the internet, no computer can control and change the entire blockchain, so data are protected from interference.Thirdly, it has transparency. Each transaction is publicly verified by a community of network users, rather than by a central authority.
4: But blockchain also has disadvantages. First, Blockchain trilemma is the challenge developers face when trying to achieve security, decentralization, and scalability. In which processes in one component must be at the expense of another component.The second is 51% attack. For blockchain networks with a small number of users, the Blockchain can be attacked by hackers with more computing power than the majority of nodes in the network. If this happens, an attacker can change or overwrite already confirmed blocks. 
5: In conclusion, Blockchain is a new and advanced technology, with potential in many industries and fields. Blockchain brings many benefits of decentralization, safety and transparency to users. However, blockchain also needs to solve problem of speed and security.
